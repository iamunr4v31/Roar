# ROAR - An NLP/Speech Processing Toolkit for Indic Languages

## Introduction

ROAR is a toolkit for Indic languages that provides a unified interface for various NLP and Speech Processing tasks. It is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (WIP). It is based on a lean fork of Nvidia's [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit. Majorly targeting Text-to-Speech Synthesis ROAR aims to streamline developer workflow from implementing new models with pre-implemented modularized functions that can be re-used across projects/models.

## Instructions

To setup the toolkit, clone the repository and follow the instructions given below.

```
pip install Cython
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally to use flash attention:
```
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
**Note**: You need Ampere or newer gpus to run flash attention and the CUDA version should be >= 11.6

After installing the requirements, 

### Step 1:

```
python scripts/dataset_processing/tts/extract_sup_data.py \
    manifest_filepath=<manifest_filepath> \
    sup_data_path=<sup_data_path> \
    dataset.sample_rate=<sample_rate> \
    dataset.n_fft=<n_fft> \
    dataset.win_length=<win_length> \
    dataset.hop_length=<hop_length> \
```

### Step 2:

```
python examples/tts/fastpitch.py \
    --config-name=fastpitch_22050_align \
    train_dataset=<train_dataset_path> \
    validation_datasets=<validation_dataset_path> \
    sup_data_types="['align_prior_matrix', 'pitch', 'speaker_id']" \
    sup_data_path=<sup_data_path> \
    pitch_mean=<pitch_mean> \
    pitch_std=<pitch_std> \
    +exp_manager.create_wandb_logger=True \
    +exp_manager.wandb_logger_kwargs.name="tutorial-FastPitch-multispeaker" \
    +exp_manager.wandb_logger_kwargs.project="NeMo" \
```

A more in-depth tutorial will be added soon.
